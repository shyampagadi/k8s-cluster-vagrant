## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Disaster Recovery Strategies
- **RTO/RPO**: Recovery Time and Point Objectives
- **Multi-Region**: Cross-region disaster recovery
- **Backup Strategies**: Automated backup and retention
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automated and manual failover

### 2. Data Protection
- **Replication**: Real-time and scheduled data replication
- **Backup**: Point-in-time recovery and snapshots
- **Encryption**: Secure backup and recovery
- **Validation**: Backup integrity and testing

### 3. Business Continuity
- **Testing**: Regular disaster recovery testing
- **Documentation**: Recovery procedures and runbooks
- **Monitoring**: Disaster recovery monitoring and alerting
- **Communication**: Incident response and communication
