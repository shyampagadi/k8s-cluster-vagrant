  fqdn              = aws_lb.primary.dns_name
  port              = 80
  type              = "HTTP"
  resource_path     = "/health"
  failure_threshold = 3
  request_interval = 30
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Purpose     = "disaster-recovery"
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "primary" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = "app.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  
  alias {
    name                   = aws_lb.primary.dns_name
    zone_id                = aws_lb.primary.zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
  
  failover_routing_policy {
    type = "PRIMARY"
  }
  
  health_check_id = aws_route53_health_check.primary.id
}
```

### Failover Steps
1. **Detection**: Automated failure detection
2. **Notification**: Alert relevant teams
3. **Assessment**: Evaluate failure scope and impact
4. **Decision**: Determine failover necessity
5. **Execution**: Initiate failover procedures
6. **Validation**: Verify failover success
7. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders
8. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring post-failover
