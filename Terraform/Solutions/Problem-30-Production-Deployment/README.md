## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-Green**: Zero-downtime deployment with instant switching
- **Canary**: Gradual rollout with traffic splitting
- **Rolling**: Incremental deployment with health checks
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime feature toggling

### 2. Production Patterns
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Safety mechanisms for failed deployments
- **Traffic Management**: Load balancer configuration
- **Database Migrations**: Safe database updates

### 3. Monitoring and Observability
- **Deployment Monitoring**: Real-time deployment tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Application performance monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Error detection and alerting
- **User Experience**: End-user impact monitoring
