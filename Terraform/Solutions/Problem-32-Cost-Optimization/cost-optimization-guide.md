# Cost Optimization Guide and Best Practices

## Overview
This comprehensive guide covers cost optimization strategies for AWS infrastructure managed with Terraform, including resource right-sizing, automated scaling, reserved instances, and comprehensive cost monitoring.

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Cost Optimization Principles
1. **Right-Sizing**: Match resources to actual requirements
2. **Automated Scaling**: Scale resources based on demand
3. **Reserved Capacity**: Use reserved instances for predictable workloads
4. **Spot Instances**: Leverage spot instances for flexible workloads
5. **Resource Tagging**: Implement comprehensive cost allocation
6. **Regular Review**: Continuous cost monitoring and optimization

### Cost Categories
- **Compute Costs**: EC2 instances, Lambda functions, containers
- **Storage Costs**: S3, EBS, EFS storage and data transfer
- **Network Costs**: Data transfer, load balancers, NAT gateways
- **Database Costs**: RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache
- **Monitoring Costs**: CloudWatch, logging, and alerting
- **Security Costs**: KMS, IAM, security services

## Resource Right-Sizing

### EC2 Instance Optimization
```hcl
# Auto Scaling Group with cost optimization
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "cost_optimized" {
  name                = "cost-optimized-asg"
  vpc_zone_identifier = aws_subnet.private[*].id
  health_check_type   = "EC2"
  
  min_size         = 1
  max_size         = 10
  desired_capacity = 2
  
  mixed_instances_policy {
    launch_template {
      launch_template_specification {
        launch_template_id = aws_launch_template.cost_optimized.id
        version           = "$Latest"
      }
      
      override {
        instance_type = "t3.small"
      }
      
      override {
        instance_type = "t3.medium"
      }
    }
    
    instances_distribution {
      on_demand_base_capacity                  = 1
      on_demand_percentage_above_base_capacity = 20
      spot_allocation_strategy                 = "diversified"
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Optimization
```hcl
# S3 lifecycle configuration for cost optimization
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "cost_optimization" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id

  rule {
    id     = "cost_optimization"
    status = "Enabled"

    transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }

    transition {
      days          = 90
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }

    transition {
      days          = 365
      storage_class = "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
    }

    expiration {
      days = 2555  # 7 years
    }
  }
}
```

## Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

### Reserved Instance Strategy
- **Standard RIs**: 1-3 year commitments for predictable workloads
- **Convertible RIs**: Flexible instance type changes
- **Regional RIs**: Regional flexibility within AWS region
- **Zonal RIs**: Specific availability zone commitment

### Savings Plans
- **Compute Savings Plans**: Flexible compute usage
- **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**: EC2-specific savings
- **SageMaker Savings Plans**: Machine learning workloads

### Implementation Example
```hcl
# Reserved instance recommendation (manual purchase)
# This is typically done through AWS Console or CLI
# Terraform can be used to track and manage RI utilization

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "ri_utilization" {
  alarm_name          = "reserved-instance-utilization"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "ReservedInstanceUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = "86400"  # 24 hours
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = "80"
  alarm_description   = "Reserved instance utilization below 80%"
}
```

## Spot Instances and Flexible Computing

### Spot Instance Strategy
- **Batch Workloads**: Non-critical batch processing
- **Development/Testing**: Development and testing environments
- **Web Applications**: Stateless web applications
- **Data Processing**: Big data and analytics workloads

### Spot Fleet Configuration
```hcl
# Spot fleet for cost optimization
resource "aws_spot_fleet_request" "cost_optimized" {
  iam_fleet_role = aws_iam_role.spot_fleet.arn
  
  target_capacity = 10
  allocation_strategy = "diversified"
  
  launch_specification {
    ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
    instance_type = "t3.micro"
    key_name      = aws_key_pair.main.key_name
    
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
    subnet_id              = aws_subnet.private[0].id
    
    user_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/templates/user_data.sh", {
      project_name = var.project_name
    }))
  }
  
  launch_specification {
    ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
    instance_type = "t3.small"
    key_name      = aws_key_pair.main.key_name
    
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
    subnet_id              = aws_subnet.private[1].id
    
    user_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/templates/user_data.sh", {
      project_name = var.project_name
    }))
  }
}
```

## Automated Scaling and Cost Management

### Auto Scaling Configuration
```hcl
# Auto Scaling policies for cost optimization
resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "scale_up" {
  name                   = "scale-up-policy"
  scaling_adjustment     = 1
  adjustment_type        = "ChangeInCapacity"
  cooldown               = 300
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.main.name
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "scale_down" {
  name                   = "scale-down-policy"
  scaling_adjustment     = -1
  adjustment_type        = "ChangeInCapacity"
  cooldown               = 300
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.main.name
}

# CloudWatch alarms for scaling
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cpu_high" {
  alarm_name          = "cpu-high"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = "300"
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = "70"
  alarm_description   = "CPU utilization high"
  alarm_actions       = [aws_autoscaling_policy.scale_up.arn]
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cpu_low" {
  alarm_name          = "cpu-low"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = "300"
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = "20"
  alarm_description   = "CPU utilization low"

  time_unit    = "MONTHLY"
  
  cost_filters = {
    Tag = ["Environment:production"]
  }
  
  notification {
    comparison_operator        = "GREATER_THAN"
    threshold                 = 80
    threshold_type            = "PERCENTAGE"
    notification_type         = "ACTUAL"
    subscriber_email_addresses = ["admin@example.com"]
  }
  
  notification {
    comparison_operator        = "GREATER_THAN"
    threshold                 = 100
    threshold_type            = "PERCENTAGE"
    notification_type         = "FORECASTED"
    subscriber_email_addresses = ["admin@example.com"]
  }
}
```
