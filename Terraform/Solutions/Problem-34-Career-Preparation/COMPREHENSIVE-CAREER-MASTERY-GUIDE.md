### Behavioral Interview Preparation
```markdown
# STAR Method Examples

## Situation: Infrastructure Outage
**Situation**: Production database became unavailable during peak traffic
**Task**: Restore service and prevent future occurrences
**Action**: 
- Implemented automated failover using Terraform
- Created monitoring and alerting with CloudWatch
- Established disaster recovery procedures
**Result**: Reduced MTTR from 2 hours to 15 minutes, 99.9% uptime achieved

## Situation: Cost Optimization Challenge
**Situation**: AWS costs increased 300% without performance improvement
**Task**: Reduce costs while maintaining performance
**Action**:
- Analyzed usage patterns with Cost Explorer
- Implemented spot instances and reserved capacity
- Created automated shutdown schedules for dev/staging
**Result**: Reduced costs by 60% while improving performance 20%
