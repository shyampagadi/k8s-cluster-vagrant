## 🔧 Customization Options

### Environment-Specific Loop Configuration
```hcl
# Development environment - minimal resources
locals {
  dev_config = {
    instances = {
      web = { count = 1, type = "t3.micro" }
      app = { count = 1, type = "t3.micro" }
      db  = { count = 1, type = "t3.micro" }
    }
    regions = ["us-west-2"]
  }
}

# Production environment - high availability
locals {
  prod_config = {
    instances = {
      web = { count = 3, type = "t3.large" }
      app = { count = 3, type = "t3.large" }
      db  = { count = 2, type = "t3.xlarge" }
    }
    regions = ["us-west-2", "us-east-1"]
  }
}

# Dynamic resource creation based on environment
resource "aws_instance" "dynamic" {
  for_each = var.environment == "production" ? local.prod_config.instances : local.dev_config.instances
  
  ami           = data.aws_ami.example.id
  instance_type = each.value.type
  count         = each.value.count
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${each.key}-${count.index + 1}"
    Environment = var.environment
    Tier        = each.key
  }
}
```

### Multi-Region Loop Implementation
```hcl
# Multi-region resource creation
locals {
  regions = ["us-west-2", "us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
  
  region_config = {
    for region in local.regions : region => {
      instances = {
        web = { count = 2, type = "t3.medium" }
        app = { count = 2, type = "t3.medium" }
      }
      subnets = {
        public  = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
        private = ["10.0.11.0/24", "10.0.12.0/24"]
      }
    }
  }
}

# Create resources across multiple regions
resource "aws_instance" "multi_region" {
  for_each = {
    for region in local.regions : region => {
      for tier, config in local.region_config[region].instances : "${region}-${tier}" => {
        region = region
        tier   = tier
        count  = config.count
        type   = config.type
      }
    }
  }
  
  provider = aws.${each.value.region}
  
  ami           = data.aws_ami.example[each.value.region].id
  instance_type = each.value.type
  
  tags = {
    Name     = "${each.value.tier}-${each.value.region}"
    Region   = each.value.region
    Tier     = each.value.tier
  }
}
```

### Complex Data Transformation Loops
```hcl
# Complex data transformation with loops
locals {
  # Transform complex input data
  transformed_data = {
    for key, value in var.complex_input : key => {
      # Process each item
      processed_value = {
        for subkey, subvalue in value : subkey => {
          # Apply transformations
          transformed = upper(subvalue.name)
          validated   = length(subvalue.name) > 3 ? subvalue.name : "default-${subkey}"
          metadata    = {
            original = subvalue.name
            processed = upper(subvalue.name)
            timestamp = timestamp()
          }
        }
      }
      
      # Generate derived data
      derived_data = {
        total_items = length(value)
        has_items   = length(value) > 0
        categories  = distinct([for item in value : item.category])
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Generate dynamic configurations
  dynamic_configs = {
    for key, data in local.transformed_data : key => {
      for subkey, subdata in data.processed_value : subkey => {
        config = {
          name     = subdata.validated
          metadata = subdata.metadata
          enabled  = data.derived_data.has_items

    }
  }
}
