  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
  
  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }
  
  filter {
    name   = "architecture"

    values = ["available"]
  }
}

# Select subnets based on criteria
locals {
  selected_subnets = [
    for subnet in data.aws_subnets.available.ids :
    subnet if contains(data.aws_subnet.details[subnet].tags, "Tier", "public")
  ]
}
```

# Primary region resources
data "aws_ami" "primary" {
  provider = aws.primary
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
  
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
