## 🏗️ Foundation Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Custom Provider Setup
**Objective**: Create your first custom provider with basic CRUD operations

**Tasks**:
1. Set up Go development environment for Terraform providers
2. Create basic provider structure with schema definition
3. Implement Create and Read operations for a simple resource
4. Test provider locally with Terraform configuration

**Expected Outcome**: Working custom provider that can create and read a simple resource

**Validation**:
```bash
# Test basic provider functionality
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Exercise 2: Complete CRUD Implementation
**Objective**: Implement full CRUD lifecycle for custom resources

**Tasks**:
1. Add Update operation with proper state management
2. Implement Delete operation with cleanup logic
3. Add proper error handling and validation
4. Test all CRUD operations with state transitions

**Expected Outcome**: Fully functional custom provider with complete lifecycle management

**Validation**:
```bash
# Test full CRUD cycle
terraform apply
terraform plan  # Should show no changes
# Modify configuration
terraform apply  # Should update resource
terraform destroy  # Should clean up properly
```

### Exercise 3: Data Source Implementation
**Objective**: Add data source capabilities to your custom provider

**Tasks**:
1. Define data source schema and attributes
2. Implement data source read functionality
3. Add filtering and query capabilities
4. Test data source with various query patterns

**Expected Outcome**: Custom provider with both resource and data source capabilities

## 🔧 Intermediate Exercises

### Exercise 4: Advanced Schema Patterns
**Objective**: Implement complex schema patterns and validation

**Tasks**:
1. Add nested block schemas with complex types
2. Implement custom validation functions
3. Add computed attributes and dependencies
4. Test schema validation with edge cases

**Expected Outcome**: Robust provider with enterprise-grade schema validation

### Exercise 5: Authentication and Configuration
**Objective**: Implement secure authentication patterns

**Tasks**:
1. Add provider configuration with authentication
2. Implement multiple authentication methods (API key, OAuth, etc.)
3. Add secure credential handling and validation
4. Test authentication with different credential types

**Expected Outcome**: Secure provider with flexible authentication options

### Exercise 6: Error Handling and Retry Logic
**Objective**: Build resilient provider with proper error handling

**Tasks**:
1. Implement comprehensive error handling patterns
2. Add retry logic for transient failures
3. Create meaningful error messages and diagnostics
4. Test error scenarios and recovery patterns

**Expected Outcome**: Resilient provider that handles failures gracefully

## 🚀 Advanced Exercises

### Exercise 7: State Management and Import
**Objective**: Implement advanced state management features

**Tasks**:
1. Add resource import functionality
2. Implement state migration patterns
3. Add state validation and consistency checks
4. Test import and migration scenarios

**Expected Outcome**: Provider with full state lifecycle management

### Exercise 8: Performance Optimization
**Objective**: Optimize provider performance for large-scale deployments

**Tasks**:
1. Implement concurrent operations where safe
2. Add caching mechanisms for expensive operations
3. Optimize API calls and reduce round trips
4. Performance test with large resource counts

**Expected Outcome**: High-performance provider suitable for enterprise use

### Exercise 9: Plugin System and Extensibility
**Objective**: Build extensible provider architecture

**Tasks**:
1. Design plugin architecture for extensibility
2. Implement configuration-driven behavior
3. Add hooks and callbacks for customization
4. Test extensibility with custom plugins

**Expected Outcome**: Extensible provider architecture for diverse use cases

## 🎓 Expert Exercises

### Exercise 10: Comprehensive Testing Suite
**Objective**: Build production-grade testing infrastructure

**Tasks**:
1. Implement unit tests for all provider functions
2. Add integration tests with real API interactions
3. Create acceptance tests with Terraform configurations
4. Set up automated testing pipeline

**Expected Outcome**: Fully tested provider with comprehensive test coverage

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Run unit tests
go test ./...

# Run acceptance tests
TF_ACC=1 go test ./...

# Run integration tests
make test-integration
```

### Exercise 11: Documentation and Examples
**Objective**: Create comprehensive provider documentation

**Tasks**:
1. Generate provider documentation with terraform-plugin-docs
2. Create comprehensive usage examples
3. Add troubleshooting guides and FAQ
4. Build interactive documentation website

**Expected Outcome**: Professional documentation suite for provider users

### Exercise 12: Release and Distribution
**Objective**: Prepare provider for production release

**Tasks**:
1. Set up automated release pipeline
2. Configure Terraform Registry publishing
3. Add versioning and changelog management
4. Test installation from Terraform Registry

**Expected Outcome**: Production-ready provider available in Terraform Registry

## 🔍 Validation and Testing

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Validate provider code
make validate

# Run all tests
make test

# Build provider binary
make build

# Test with Terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
