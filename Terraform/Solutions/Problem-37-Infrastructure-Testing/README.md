# Problem 37: Infrastructure Testing with Terratest and Validation

## Overview

This solution demonstrates comprehensive infrastructure testing patterns using Terraform's built-in validation, check blocks, and testing frameworks.

## Key Concepts

- **Variable Validation**: Input validation using validation blocks
- **Check Blocks**: Runtime assertions for infrastructure state
- **Test Assertions**: Automated testing patterns
- **Resource Validation**: Ensuring infrastructure meets requirements

## Features

- Variable validation with custom error messages
- Runtime checks using check blocks
- Test data transformations and assertions
- Infrastructure compliance validation
- Automated testing patterns

## Usage

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Testing Patterns

1. **Input Validation**: Variables are validated before execution
2. **Runtime Checks**: Infrastructure state is validated during apply
3. **Output Testing**: Results are validated and reported
4. **Compliance Checks**: Resources meet security and compliance requirements

## Integration with Testing Frameworks

This example can be extended with:
- Terratest for Go-based testing
- Kitchen-Terraform for Ruby-based testing
- Pytest for Python-based testing
- Custom validation scripts
