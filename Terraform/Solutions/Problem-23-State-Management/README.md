    key            = "infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-dev"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

# Production environment
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-prod"
    key            = "infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"

    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  }

```hcl
# Primary region state
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-primary"

    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-primary"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

# Secondary region backup
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-secondary"
    key            = "infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-secondary"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

### Team-Based State Access
```hcl
# Team-specific state paths
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-shared"
    key            = "teams/${var.team_name}/infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-shared"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```
