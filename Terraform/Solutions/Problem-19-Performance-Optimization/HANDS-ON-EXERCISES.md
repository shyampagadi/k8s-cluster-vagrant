# Problem 19: Performance Optimization - Hands-On Exercises

## Exercise 1: Basic Implementation (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Implement basic Performance Optimization functionality
**Difficulty**: Beginner

### Requirements
- Understand core concepts of Performance Optimization
- Implement basic configuration
- Test and validate functionality
- Document lessons learned

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Create exercise directory
mkdir problem-19-exercise
cd problem-19-exercise

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init
```

#### Step 2: Basic Configuration
```hcl
# Create main.tf with basic implementation
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# Basic implementation specific to Performance Optimization
# Add your configuration here
```

#### Step 3: Testing and Validation
```bash
# Validate configuration
terraform validate

# Plan deployment
terraform plan

# Apply configuration
terraform apply

# Verify results
terraform output
```
