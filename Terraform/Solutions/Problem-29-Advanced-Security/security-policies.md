# Advanced Security Policies and Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive security policies and implementation strategies for enterprise-grade Terraform infrastructure, focusing on zero-trust architecture, compliance frameworks, and advanced security patterns.

## Zero Trust Security Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request must be authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Users and systems get minimum necessary permissions
3. **Micro-segmentation**: Network isolation at the smallest possible level
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and threat detection

### Implementation Strategies

#### Network Security
- **VPC Isolation**: Separate VPCs for different environments and workloads
- **Private Subnets**: All application resources in private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive inbound/outbound rules
- **NACLs**: Additional network-level access control
- **VPN/Private Connectivity**: Secure access to private resources

#### Identity and Access Management
- **IAM Roles**: Service-to-service authentication
- **IAM Policies**: Granular permission management
- **MFA Enforcement**: Multi-factor authentication for all users
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Environment-specific roles
- **Temporary Credentials**: Short-lived access tokens

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: KMS-managed encryption keys
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS/SSL for all communications
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation policies
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive data identification and protection
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted backup and recovery

## Compliance Frameworks

### SOC 2 Type II Compliance
- **Security**: Access controls and data protection
- **Availability**: System uptime and performance monitoring
- **Processing Integrity**: Data processing accuracy and completeness
- **Confidentiality**: Protection of confidential information
- **Privacy**: Personal information protection

### PCI-DSS Compliance
- **Network Security**: Secure network architecture
- **Data Protection**: Cardholder data encryption
- **Access Control**: Restricted access to cardholder data
- **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring
- **Incident Response**: Security incident procedures

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Security policies and procedures
- **Physical Safeguards**: Physical access controls
- **Technical Safeguards**: Technical security measures
- **Risk Assessment**: Regular security risk assessments
- **Audit Controls**: Security event logging and monitoring

### GDPR Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only as long as necessary
- **Accuracy**: Keep data accurate and up-to-date
- **Security**: Protect personal data with appropriate measures

## Security Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudTrail Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "security_audit" {
  name                          = "security-audit-trail"
  s3_bucket_name                = aws_s3_bucket.audit_logs.id
  include_global_service_events = true
  is_multi_region_trail         = true
  enable_logging                = true
  enable_log_file_validation    = true
  
  event_selector {
    read_write_type                 = "All"
    include_management_events       = true
    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["arn:aws:s3:::"]
    }
  }
}
```

### CloudWatch Monitoring
- **Security Metrics**: Failed login attempts, privilege escalations
- **Performance Metrics**: Resource utilization and performance
- **Compliance Metrics**: Policy violations and deviations
- **Cost Metrics**: Unusual spending patterns

### SIEM Integration
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized log collection
- **Threat Detection**: Automated threat identification
- **Incident Response**: Automated response procedures
- **Forensic Analysis**: Security incident investigation

## Encryption and Key Management

### AWS KMS Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_kms_key" "security_key" {
  description             = "Security encryption key"
  deletion_window_in_days = 7
  enable_key_rotation    = true
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid    = "Enable IAM User Permissions"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          AWS = "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:root"
        }
        Action   = "kms:*"
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### Encryption Best Practices
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation every 90 days
- **Key Separation**: Different keys for different environments
- **Access Control**: Strict key access policies
- **Audit Logging**: All key usage logged
- **Backup Keys**: Secure key backup procedures

## Security Automation

### Policy as Code
- **Sentinel Policies**: HashiCorp Sentinel for policy enforcement
- **OPA Policies**: Open Policy Agent for policy management

1. **Detection**: Automated threat detection
2. **Analysis**: Security incident analysis
3. **Containment**: Threat containment procedures
4. **Eradication**: Threat removal and cleanup
5. **Recovery**: System recovery and restoration
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review

### Communication Plan
