## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture
- **Network Segmentation**: Micro-segmentation and network isolation
- **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication and identity management
- **Least Privilege**: Principle of least privilege access
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring

### 2. Compliance Frameworks
- **SOC2**: Service Organization Control 2 compliance
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation

### 3. Advanced Security Features
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption implementation
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS and key rotation
- **Security Monitoring**: SIEM and threat detection
- **Incident Response**: Automated incident response

## Implementation Details
