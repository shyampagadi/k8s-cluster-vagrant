# IAM (Identity and Access Management) - Complete Terraform Guide

## 🎯 Overview

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the foundation of AWS security. It controls who can access what AWS resources and how they can access them. IAM is essential for every AWS deployment and should be the first service you master.

### **What is IAM?**
IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Users**: Individual people or applications
- **Groups**: Collections of users
- **Roles**: Temporary permissions for AWS services or users
- **Policies**: Documents that define permissions
- **Access Keys**: Programmatic access credentials

### **When to Use IAM**
- **Every AWS deployment** - IAM is mandatory
- **Multi-user environments** - Managing team access
- **Application security** - Service-to-service authentication
- **Compliance requirements** - Audit trails and access control
- **Cost management** - Controlling resource access
