# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - Complete Terraform Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the foundation of AWS networking. It provides a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. VPC is essential for every AWS deployment and provides the networking foundation for all other services.

### **What is VPC?**
VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It's logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud and provides complete control over your virtual networking environment, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.

### **Key Concepts**
- **VPC**: Virtual network isolated from other AWS accounts
- **Subnets**: Segments of your VPC's IP address range
- **Route Tables**: Rules that determine where network traffic is directed
- **Internet Gateway**: Gateway that connects your VPC to the internet
- **NAT Gateway**: Allows private subnets to access the internet
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level security

### **When to Use VPC**
- **Every AWS deployment** - VPC is the foundation
- **Network isolation** - Separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
- **Compliance requirements** - Network security and isolation
- **Hybrid cloud** - Connect to on-premises networks
- **Multi-tier applications** - Separate web, app, and database tiers

## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability

### **VPC Flow Logs**

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### **Network ACLs**
```hcl
# Network ACL for public subnets
resource "aws_network_acl" "public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  
  ingress {
    protocol   = "tcp"
    rule_no    = 100
    action     = "allow"
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    from_port  = 80
    to_port    = 80
  }
  
  ingress {
    protocol   = "tcp"
    rule_no    = 110
    action     = "allow"
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    from_port  = 443
    to_port    = 443
  }
  
  ingress {
    protocol   = "tcp"
    rule_no    = 120
    action     = "allow"
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    from_port  = 22
    to_port    = 22
  }
  
  egress {
    protocol   = "tcp"
    rule_no    = 100
    action     = "allow"
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    from_port  = 0
    to_port    = 65535
  }
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Public Network ACL"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Associate Network ACL with public subnets
resource "aws_network_acl_association" "public" {
  count = 2
  
  network_acl_id = aws_network_acl.public.id
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public[count.index].id
}
```

### **Security Group Rules**
```hcl
# Restrictive security group
resource "aws_security_group" "restrictive" {
  name_prefix = "restrictive-"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id
  
  # Allow HTTP from specific IP ranges
  ingress {

    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.0/24"] # Office IP range
  }
  
  # Allow HTTPS from specific IP ranges
  ingress {
    description = "HTTPS from office"
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.0/24"] # Office IP range
  }
  
  # Allow SSH from specific IP ranges
  ingress {

    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.0/24"] # Office IP range
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Restrictive Security Group"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```

### **VPC Peering Security**
```hcl
# VPC peering connection
resource "aws_vpc_peering_connection" "peer" {
  peer_vpc_id   = aws_vpc.peer.id
  vpc_id        = aws_vpc.main.id
  peer_region   = "us-west-1"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "VPC Peering Connection"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Route table entries for peering
resource "aws_route" "peer_route" {
  route_table_id            = aws_route_table.private.id
  destination_cidr_block    = "10.1.0.0/16"
  vpc_peering_connection_id = aws_vpc_peering_connection.peer.id
}
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### **NAT Gateway Optimization**
```hcl
# Single NAT Gateway for cost optimization
resource "aws_eip" "nat" {
  domain = "vpc"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "NAT Gateway EIP"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "single" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public[0].id
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Single NAT Gateway"
    Environment = "production"
  }
  
  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.main]
}

# Route all private subnets through single NAT Gateway
resource "aws_route_table" "private_single" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  
  route {
    cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
    nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.single.id
  }
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Private Route Table (Single NAT)"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```

### **VPC Endpoint Optimization**
```hcl
# VPC endpoints to reduce NAT Gateway costs
resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "s3" {
  vpc_id       = aws_vpc.main.id
  service_name = "com.amazonaws.${data.aws_region.current.name}.s3"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "S3 VPC Endpoint"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "dynamodb" {
  vpc_id       = aws_vpc.main.id
  service_name = "com.amazonaws.${data.aws_region.current.name}.dynamodb"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "DynamoDB VPC Endpoint"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue: Cannot Access Internet from Private Subnets**
```hcl
# Debug route table
resource "aws_route_table" "debug_private" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  
  route {

  }
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Debug Private Route Table"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Verify NAT Gateway is in public subnet
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "debug" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public[0].id # Must be in public subnet
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Debug NAT Gateway"
    Environment = "production"
  }
  
  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.main]
}
```

#### **Issue: Security Group Rules Not Working**
```hcl
# Debug security group with explicit rules
resource "aws_security_group" "debug" {
  name_prefix = "debug-"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id
  
  # Explicit ingress rules
  ingress {

    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  # Explicit egress rules
  egress {
    description = "All outbound traffic"
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Debug Security Group"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```

#### **Issue: VPC Peering Connection Problems**
```hcl
# VPC peering with explicit configuration
resource "aws_vpc_peering_connection" "debug" {
  peer_vpc_id   = aws_vpc.peer.id
  vpc_id        = aws_vpc.main.id

## 📚 Real-World Examples

### **E-Commerce Platform VPC**
```hcl
# E-commerce platform VPC structure
locals {
  ecommerce_vpc = {
    cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
    subnets = {
      web = {
        cidr = "10.0.1.0/24"
        az   = "us-west-2a"
        type = "public"
      }
      app = {

        az   = "us-west-2a"
        type = "private"
      }
      db = {
        cidr = "10.0.100.0/24"
        az   = "us-west-2a"
        type = "private"
      }
    }
  }

  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.microservices.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${index(local.microservices, each.value) + 10}.0/24"
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[0]
