      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }

    # Transition to Glacier after 90 days
    transition {
      days          = 90
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }

    # Transition to Deep Archive after 365 days
    transition {
      days          = 365
      storage_class = "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
    }

    # Delete incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days
    abort_incomplete_multipart_upload {
      days_after_initiation = 7
    }

    # Delete old versions after 30 days
    noncurrent_version_expiration {
      noncurrent_days = 30
    }
  }
}
```

### **Storage Class Optimization**
```hcl
# S3 bucket with intelligent tiering
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "intelligent_tiering" {
  bucket = "intelligent-tiering-bucket-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Intelligent Tiering S3 Bucket"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Intelligent tiering configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_intelligent_tiering_configuration" "main" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.intelligent_tiering.id
  name   = "main-tiering"

  status = "Enabled"

  filter {
    prefix = "data/"
  }

  tiering {
    access_tier = "ARCHIVE_ACCESS"
    days        = 90
  }

  tiering {
    access_tier = "DEEP_ARCHIVE_ACCESS"
    days        = 180
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue: Bucket Access Denied**
```hcl
# Debug bucket policy
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "debug" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.main.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "AllowAllActions"
        Effect    = "Allow"
        Principal = "*"
        Action    = "s3:*"
        Resource = [
          aws_s3_bucket.main.arn,
          "${aws_s3_bucket.main.arn}/*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### **Issue: CORS Configuration Problems**
```hcl
# Debug CORS configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration" "debug" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.main.id

  cors_rule {
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    allowed_methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"]
    allowed_origins = ["*"]
    expose_headers  = ["ETag", "x-amz-request-id"]
    max_age_seconds = 3000
  }
}
```

#### **Issue: Lifecycle Policy Not Working**
```hcl
# Debug lifecycle policy
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "debug" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.main.id

  rule {
    id     = "debug_lifecycle"
    status = "Enabled"

    # Immediate transition for testing
    transition {
      days          = 1
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }

    # Delete after 7 days for testing
    expiration {
      days = 7
    }
  }
}
```

## 📚 Real-World Examples

### **Static Website Hosting**
```hcl
# S3 bucket for static website
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "website" {
  bucket = "website-bucket-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Website S3 Bucket"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Website configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "website" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website.id

  index_document {
    suffix = "index.html"
  }

  error_document {
    key = "error.html"
  }
}

# Public access block (allow for website)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "website" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website.id

  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}

# Bucket policy for website access
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "website" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "PublicReadGetObject"
        Effect    = "Allow"
        Principal = "*"
        Action    = "s3:GetObject"
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.website.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### **Data Lake Architecture**
```hcl
# Data lake S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data_lake" {
  bucket = "data-lake-bucket-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Data Lake S3 Bucket"
    Environment = "production"
    Project     = "data-analytics"
  }
}

# Data lake lifecycle policy
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "data_lake" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data_lake.id

  rule {
    id     = "data_lake_lifecycle"
    status = "Enabled"

    # Transition to IA after 30 days
    transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }

    # Transition to Glacier after 90 days
    transition {
      days          = 90
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }

    # Transition to Deep Archive after 365 days
    transition {
      days          = 365
      storage_class = "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
    }
  }
}

# Data lake inventory
resource "aws_s3_bucket_inventory" "data_lake" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data_lake.id
  name   = "data-lake-inventory"

  included_object_versions = "All"

  schedule {
    frequency = "Daily"
  }

  destination {
    bucket {
      format     = "CSV"
      bucket_arn = aws_s3_bucket.data_lake.arn
      prefix     = "inventory/"
    }
  }
}
```
