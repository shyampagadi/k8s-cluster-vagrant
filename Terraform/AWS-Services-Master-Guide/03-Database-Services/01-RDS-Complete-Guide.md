- **DB Subnet Groups**: Collection of subnets for DB instances
- **Parameter Groups**: Database engine configuration
- **Option Groups**: Database features and settings
- **Read Replicas**: Read-only copies of primary database
- **Multi-AZ**: High availability deployment
- **Automated Backups**: Point-in-time recovery
- **Snapshots**: Manual backups

### **When to Use RDS**
